As a Data Analyst at Banco Itaú, I work with data to support strategic decision-making and optimize business processes. I collect, prepare, and analyze data from various sources, using Python, SQL, and Tableau, and create and implement analytical models, such as forecasting, customer segmentation, risk modeling, and more. I also develop interactive reports and dashboards that summarize and communicate the results of the analyses to managers and other stakeholders.

I have a Bachelor's degree in Production Engineering and I am currently pursuing a Master of Business Administration - MBA in Data Science at Instituto de Ciências Matemáticas e de Computação (ICMC) - USP. I am passionate about statistics and technologies, and I believe in a world where more and more decisions will be driven by data. I have experience in Data and I have multiple certifications, such as CPA-20, Scrum Fundamentals, and Six Sigma Yellow Belt. My goal is to continue learning and developing my skills in data science and analytics, and to contribute to the growth and innovation of Banco Itaú and the financial sector.
